### One Name For All of Your Addresses  
No more copying and pasting long addresses. Use your ENS name to store all of your addresses and receive any cryptocurrency, token, or NFT.  

## Project
We will use this technology from ENS to help users of our trading platform manage their accounts. Indeed, it is not always easy to trade crypto currencies especially given the multitude of crypto pairs available.

We will show them the best pairs of the moment and ENS will allow them to pay us a percentage of the winnings trade made thanks to our advice.

## Why ENS ?  
The field of crypto is booming, but reliable and easy-to-learn ways do not yet exist. Pourtatn ENS exists, and thanks to it we can secure the comission of our users every month.
